This is Adobe Flash Player (Firefox plugin for Linux) unfocus hack.
This prevents the Flash Player from trapping key event.
It helps to avoid problems with key input.  For example, it helps Vimperator.

The simplest way to compile and install this package is:
(For Gentoo.  Except Gentoo, it may be necessary to adapt to the environment.)

  - `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and
    type the following command.

    $ make
    # make install

  NOTE: For Firefox 4 and later without plugin-container (or previous Firefox 4),
	use `libfph-without-plugin-container.c' instead of `libfph.c'.
	However, if together with nspluginwrapper, the above does not apply.

Setup:

  - Type the following command.

    $ ln -s /opt/fph/fph.libflashplayer.so ~/.mozilla/plugins/

Usage:

  - At first focus is disabled.
  - When focus is disabled, key event will not reach the Flash Player but Firefox.
  - When focus is enabled, it is the original behavior.
  - To enable focus when focus is disabled, middle click.
  - To disable focus when focus is enabled, press CTRL-[ key.
